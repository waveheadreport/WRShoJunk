**Shonen Junk Mission** https://shonen-junk.gitbook.io/welcome-to-shinji/

*shinji.xyz is a collective of fans, creators, and builders globally working together to create a community through art and technology.*

*the core ethos of shinji.xyz is to shape and support new ways of creating and experiencing the essence of anime & manga. we support and promote members bringing a new perspective through unique self-expression and formats.*

*we are: a decentralized global network of multidisciplinary creators reimagining anime on web3*

- a decentralized organization that is community owned & governed
- global network of multidisciplinary creators including artists, influencers, builders
- reimagining anime and building on web3


**Wavehead TLDR:** 

Think Crunchyroll/Shonen Jump but for anime, manga, comics, and new creators, all utilizing Web3 and DAO mentality to give fans and creators an avenue to share in the success. Started and lead by a Crunchyroll Co-founder(Shinji).

**Wavehead Disclaimer:** 

I purchased 10 Shonen Junk NFTs at .115e average, and am contemplating picking up more but still undecided. 

**Wavehead Strategy:** 

I see this as a long term hold. This team is stacked full of builders and those with industry experience, but this is a project that will not be built overnight. The fact there will be a token can obviously go either way, could be good, could be bad, I think we usually see that once a token plan is formed the underlying NFT experiences some form of pump but not always. The token had zero bearing on my decision to enter, I am betting on the team. If this experiences a more significant pump before a product is released I will likely sell some to recoup initial investment but am taking that in stride.
One con I noticed is when the floor pumped from .24 to .45 in one night the ShonenJunk twitter posted "The floor is wasabi" I generally don't like to see that from a project, but I have not let that shake me from my position.

**Crunchyroll Background**

## **Highlights from the Litepaper**
***The Why*** https://shonen-junk.gitbook.io/welcome-to-shinji/shinji-dao/the-why

Up until now, there has only been one way of making anime content. decisions are made top down. creators create, producers produce, distributors distribute, and consumers consume. each exists as a siloed step in the process, all less than the sum of its parts.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103300415/162556613-ff14fbbe-2a74-4aae-a473-d1988dcc7379.png)

we believe in a tomorrow where there are no gatekeepers. we believe in a community where fans and creators talk to each other and one another to create. the community will no longer be an afterthought, but the hub of anime passion and creation. only by coming together can our community be greater than the sum of our parts, and our voice be louder in unison.

together, our community of creators and fans alike can invest our time and resources, collaborate, and enjoy the fruits of our labor together.

***Why DAO*** https://shonen-junk.gitbook.io/welcome-to-shinji/shinji-dao/why-dao

Anime has increasingly become dependent on centralized monoliths for creation, communication, participation, and distribution. the atomic unit of any fandom is the individual, yet these monoliths hold the majority of ownership, and thus decision-making and value capture.

DAOs present an alternative organizational structure that allows for individuals to go from renting their passions to owning them. the relationship changes from owners & renters to everyone as co-owners. everyone who contributes to a DAO is a co-owner; the creators, the builders, the fans are the DAO - a flat peer-to-peer organization rather than hierarchies.

- instead of renting your time on subreddits, why not collectively own the discussion?
- instead of renting your subscriptions to crunchyroll & netflix, why not collectively own the content?
- instead of being the destination, why not be a part of the journey?

***The Roadmap*** https://shonen-junk.gitbook.io/welcome-to-shinji/shinji-dao/the-roadmap

**Q4 2021/Q1 2022**

The starting point is 'Unit 00 - The Prototype'. we are assembling the team necessary and building a generative anime-inspired art project in order to 1) assemble the core team, 2) learn by building,  3) grow awareness of our community
the initial NFT project mint will go towards executing on developing new IP as a community.

**Q2 2022**

From there, we plan to build 'Unit 01 - The Mangaverse'. we will expand our vision by creating projects that 1) develop new IP collaboratively within the community, and at the same time 2) compensates artists and creators in a meaningful way, and 3) expands the community.

***$hinji token Allocation*** https://shonen-junk.gitbook.io/welcome-to-shinji/shinji-dao/usdhinji-token

- circulating / airdrops - openly distributed and accessible to the public
	- Community - we will snapshot and distribute $hinji tokens to early members engaged in the community
	- Creators - we will distribute to creators buidling and creating with us
	- Investors - we will reserve an allocation for future investors in the dao. we have not decided at this point if we should bring on investors and will likely put this to a vote
- team members / strategics - tokens with vesting schedule will go towards team, advisors, and strategic partners
- community treasury - to deploy against executing on our vision of creating new content and IP

$hinji tokens will have a number of utilities, including:
- access to restricted areas of the community
- voting on direction of IP and content creation

note: exact details of these plans may be subject to change as we have more discussions with creators, strategics and the community

***The Team*** https://shonen-junk.gitbook.io/welcome-to-shinji/unit-00-the-prototype/assembling-the-team

The team includes:
- former tech and product leads for large streaming and community platform
- former content executives from disney, hulu, warner, toei animation
- former creators who have worked on projects including dragon ball super, my hero academia, one piece, fullmetal alchemist, lupin, samurai champloo, and more

***Unit 01 - The Mangaverse*** https://shonen-junk.gitbook.io/welcome-to-shinji/unit-01-the-mangaverse/what-is-the-mangaverse..

- For any new platform, there must be new IP created that embrace its capabilities. web3 is our platform, and we are embracing what it means to create content on the blockchain.
- Superman was the first superhero for DC, and first existed in the medium of comics before becoming the cornerstone of the DC Universe.
- We are setting out to create our own source material, our own IP, that is specialized for web3. this is what we call the mangaverse. an entire world of IP created by our community that is native to web3.
- Mangaverse will be creating characters that exists in the medium of web3, and moving on to building worlds through connecting these characters, all powered by the community.

*Phase 1* https://shonen-junk.gitbook.io/welcome-to-shinji/unit-01-the-mangaverse/content-building-phase-1

PFPs have backstories that are waiting to be told & nothing ties communities together better than great stories.

the process of creating manga and anime has largely been perfected & optimized & we’re not here to reinvent the wheel. instead, we’re making modifications in order to create a path to connect creators and fans directly, to open up what’s typically a closed-door process.

*Modular Story-telling* https://shonen-junk.gitbook.io/welcome-to-shinji/unit-01-the-mangaverse/introducing-modular-story-telling

Phase 1 is to plant seeds for rich stories with community members involved along the way.

Our creative development will be community driven. which character(s) should be the MC (main character)? what themes do you want the stories to explore? what tropes should be included? the creative team will solicit feedback from the community in shaping specific details of the story.

The output will be one-shots, story bibles, illustrations & concept art, animation tests, and various other intellectual property made by creators that adapts our NFTs into modular parts of our manga and anime universe. these will be the building blocks in which we build manga and anime. we plan to create NFTs from this set of output and give ShonenJunk holders priority access.

illustrations: we’ve been teasing this idea out with our creations we’ve been dropping over the past couple weeks. creator’s interpretation of a static PFP can take many forms and plant the seeds for future stories to grow.

one-shots: many of our favorite anime - naruto, dragon ball, one piece - began their journey as a one-shot.

*why?* https://shonen-junk.gitbook.io/welcome-to-shinji/unit-01-the-mangaverse/...but-why

everyone has their favorite characters, stories and moments they look fondly upon. an artist drew the character, a writer or creator came up with the story. yet, the show is owned by a few corporations, without much upside for those involved in creating the content in success. 

these few decision makers decide what we watch, and who gets paid. even though it is the fans that are ultimately paying for the experience, and the creators ultimately creating it.

we believe there can be a fundamentally different approach to how content is created and who is involved. we believe that the community - fans and creators alike - can be empowered to create new IP, and that we don't have to follow any of the existing rules. 

our characters and stories no longer need to be within their own silos, and we are giving decision making and ownership back to the fans and creators to make a new IP universe together.
